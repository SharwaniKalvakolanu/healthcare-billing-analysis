# Healthcare Billing Analysis
This is a data pipeline project using the 2023 Medicare Provider Payment Public Use File (PUF).

The goal is to learn how to:
- Read large real-world healthcare data
- Clean and analyze it using Python and Pandas
- Track progress using Git and GitHub
- Build a useful project for a job portfolio

## Project Structure

- `data/raw/`: contains the original CSV file
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `src/`: Python scripts (to be added later)
- `dashboard/`: visualizations (coming soon)

## Learning Git
